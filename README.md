# Meals for Mates

M4M is a non-profit organisation aimed at making it easier for people to help the the homeless in New Zealand.
Next time you eat out at one of our partnered stores, add a little to your bill at the end of the meal, even if it's just a dollar. This will go towards a meal for someone who needs it the most.

It all started as a pitched idea for a final group app project...
